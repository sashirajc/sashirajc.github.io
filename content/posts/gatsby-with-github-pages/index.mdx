My previous blog was built using Jekyll. But lack of experience working
with Ruby made it quite challenging to run Jekyll locally and experiment 
with the blog. I wanted to have more control over how the blog looks
and feels, so I decided to move it to a platform that I had more
experience with. 

Enter Javascript. 

I went scouting for a good platform to migrate to and discovered Gatsby. 

It was minimalistic, had plenty of support for blogging and seemed 
quite easy to adapt and migrate to. 

This is a great blog theme to start - https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog

To adapt the Gatsby site update a few places.

1. Update the `gatsby-config.js` file to add links to your own social media
sites. You could also update the plugins if needed.

2. For every blog article you have on the Jekyll site, create a new folder inside 
the `/content/posts` folder. Create a new `index.mdx` file inside each folder. 

This file holds the main contents of each blog post.

3. Next, update the `/content/pages/about/index.mdx` file to update the "about me" page.

4. You will need gh-pages package to deploy. Create a new script 
in the `packages.json` file called `deploy` 

>       "scripts": {
>        "deploy": "gatsby build && gh-pages -d public"
>       },
>

6. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy your site. This will create a new branch 
called `gh-pages` and this branch is used by Github pages to build the site.

7. If you would like to debug the deployment script use `NODE_DEBUG=gh-pages npm run deploy`

Finally, to update the Github pages site, go to the repository settings. 
Go to the pages tab and change the branch in the source section.

Give a few minutes for Github to rebuild the site.
