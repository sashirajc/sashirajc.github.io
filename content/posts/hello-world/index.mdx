Hello world!

I've finally made the switch from WordPress to GitHub pages!! Yay!

I hated WordPress for the lack of control over how I run my Javascript. And I really wanted a space which will allow me to integrate my code with the blog.

GitHub pages is the answer to all the issues I had.

Looking forward to a more fruitful blogging experience here. If you find anything useful on my blog, please leave a comment. Cheers!

UPDATE: I found this really [awesome blog](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/) to add tags to Jekyll. Thanks Long Qian

UPDATE 2022: I got tired of fighting with Rubies and Gems to get Jekyll working properly.
I had perpetual problem with ruby going out of data with every MacOS update. Not working with 
ruby professionally added to my unfamiliarity and frustration with the language. The 
latest iteration of this blog is built using Gatsby and I'm loving it so far. It is really
convenient to have a language that I can finally run on my local machine instead of having 
to deploy on GitHub pages just to view minor styling updates. 

I look forward to using Gatsby and hope it makes it easier for me to write consistently.
