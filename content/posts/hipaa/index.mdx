## Security Rule

Protect the privacy of the PHI. Allow flexibility to allow for growth and new technology. Requires appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentitality, integrity and security of electronic PHI.

CIA triad should be maintained. 

Confidentiality - Protect against unauthorized access to the protected information.

Integrity - Detect any modification. Ensure the data cannot be modified accidentally or by anyone without the necessary access.

Availability - The data should be accessible and available for the purposes for which it has been collected.

#### Basic Requirements 

..* Ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all e-PHI they create, receive, maintain or transform

### Technical Safeguards

..* Access Control - Covered entity must implement technical policies and procedures that allow only authorized persons to access e-PHI
