Rant about Windows 10 and forced Windows updates.
<!--more-->
Ever since Windows 10 was released, Microsoft took away the option to turn off 
Windows Updates. Windows would ofcourse give you a few days to download and 
install the updates, but if you ignore it you will notice the following 
- Windows would inexplicably slow down when you are in the middle of something 
- Sluggish response from your browser
- Downloads are super slow
And then you are finally presented with Microsoft's beautiful message on how they 
have decided to update YOUR computer for you because Microsoft knows best isn't it? ;)

My PC is 5 years old and Windows 10 Creators Update was in itself a bit too much 
for it. I could almost hear the hardware groaning with each new update. With the 
latest update in May, it completely gave up. The digital license that my Windows 
came with magically wasn't recognised anymore after the update. I had to deal with 
this annoying pop-up at bootup which basically said my Windows is not legit and I
 had to activate it from the Settings App -> Activation page. Alright, off we go 
 to the Activation page. But wait, the page is blank and nothing loads. So I pretty 
 much have no way other than to live with this annoying bug. Alright, doesn't matter 
 it is just a minor inconvenience anyway. Continue with your work. After a while, 
 I try to open a powerpoint slide and it refuses to open because Microsoft Office's 
 product key disappeared as well. Isn't this fun now? I later realised that my 
 computer could not play audio as well after the update. Off I go to Microsoft's 
 support chat after waiting a long weekend without any way to resolve this problem. 
 [Looks like Microsoft has a tool to hide updates](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3073930/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-driver-update-from-reinstalling-in-window). 
 This tool makes it easy for you to hide updates. But this doesn't stop Windows 
 Update Service from looking for new updates to be installed. Meanwhile maybe I 
 could develop a simple script which could check if Windows Update Service is 
 turned on at regular intervals and make sure it stays off?
