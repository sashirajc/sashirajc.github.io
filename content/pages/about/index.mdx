![Sashi](./profile.jpg)

I am Sashiraj Chandrasekaran. 

I currently work at [MSD](https://merck.com) as a Senior Software Engineer.

I previously worked at [Nalagenetics Pte Ltd](https://nalagenetics.com) in multiple capacities. 
I started at Nalagenetics as the first software engineer to join the company and I 
built the initial versions of the web portals and mobile apps used by Nalagenetics 
for order/patient management in my position as Senior Software Engineer.
I was instrumental in building the procedures and processess used by the engineering team
and ensuring it was compliant with the regulatory standards (ISO13485 / ISO27001 / IEC62304) 
adopted by the company. I raised the engineering and IT teams from scratch and served as the team lead for 
both teams until the company secured Series A funding.

I previously worked as a Backend web developer at [JiL Creation Pte Ltd](https://www.sgpbusiness.com/company/Jil-Creation-Pte-Ltd). At Jil Creation, 
I worked on multiple projects for different clients to build, API platforms 
for software, among other things a job matching application, a OTT platform, 
a MICE mobile app and an AR mobile app.

I am passionate about bringing people together to build software that helps 
to make people's life easier. I also enjoy playing with data and tinkering 
with Machine Learning.
